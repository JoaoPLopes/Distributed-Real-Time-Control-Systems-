# Distributed-Real-Time-Control-Systems-
Real-Time Cooperative Decentralized Control of a Smart Office Illumination System. "Distributed Real Time Control Systems" course project.

Project developed for the course [Distributed Real Time Control Systems](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/SCDTR77/2019-2020/1-semestre/pagina-inicial) in my master's program at IST.

The objective of this project was to design a real-time control system for a distributed illumination system in a small-scale model of an office space.
